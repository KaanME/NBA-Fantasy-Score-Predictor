My method was to make sure the code worked for the first few iterations of each function and run the code on its own while I stepped away from the computer. The full raw data files are located in the data folder of the repo as \"dkDataraw.p\", \"player_logs.csv\", and \"team_logs.csv'. To see how I went about cleaning the data, shift over to the Data Wrangling Notebooks."
